# ComputationalGeometry_FirstPrinciplesAlgorithmDesign
Under continuous development & improvement, alongside my job, developed custom algorithms (C++) without using any ready-made libraries.
Implemented Meshing (Delaunay Triangulation) | 2D & 3D (Gift Wrapping) Convex Hull Generation | Point inside Polygon (2D) & Polyhedron (3D) | Ray Casting | 3D space Line-Line, Plane-Plane, Line-Plane intersection | Computing the common area of 2D shapes (ongoing) | Graphical representation/Visualization using OpenGL (ongoing)
